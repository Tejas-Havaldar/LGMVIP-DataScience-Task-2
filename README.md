# LGMVIP-DataScience-Task-2

Note: The dataset for this project is quite big in size so I am unable to upload the dataset here

I will be uploading the link for the dataset here 
Link:  https://bit.ly/2TK5Xn5
after downloading the dataset please rename the dataset as "Global-Terrorism". 

In this project I have done the Exploratory Data Analysis on Terrorism across the globe and tried to find answers to some question (like Country with the most attacks, City with the most attacks, etc)

I have used python 3 and its libraries for the analysis
